# GROUP BY and HAVING - Conclusion

In this exercise we learned how to combine our aggregate functions with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

  * GROUP BY allows us to combine the results based on a column so an aggregate can be applied to each group.

  * HAVING allows us to filter our results based on the result of an aggregate function.

This makes using aggregate functions much more powerful in our queries.
